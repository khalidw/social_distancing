# Social Distancing Detection
In the fight against the coronavirus, social distancing has proven to be a very effective measure to slow down the spread of the disease. Few months ago millions of people are staying at home to help flatten the curve but they are doing their jobs to earn and fulfilling their needs. As vaccine for Covid-19 has not been produced yet so best way to fight against Covid-19 is to wear masks and ensure social distancing.

To help ensure social distancing, we have developed an AI-enabled social distancing detection tool that can detect if people are keeping a safe distance from each other by analyzing real time video streams from the camera.

Our approach consists of three steps:
* Detect the humans in the frame
* Calculate the distance between all the instances of humans detected in the frame.
* Show number of social distancing violations on the screen
